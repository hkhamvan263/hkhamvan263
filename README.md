My name is Hannah Khamvanthong, and I am a first-generation, senior computer science student graduating on December 14, 2024. I'm currently looking for an on-campus/remote/hybrid Fall internship before I graduate from A&T. Additionally, I'm interested in an undergraduate research position related to AI, Data Science, Data Analytics, and other computer science related research positions. When I graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science, I am planning on seeking employment as either a SWE/SDE/Software Dev, game developer, or data analyst while possibly attending UNC Chapel Hill for the MADS program.
